  <h4>Queen's University Belfast XP Work Experience (2025)</h4>
I completed a week-long work experience event at Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland. This work experience involved teams working to develop a solution to one of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals involving modern technology. My team succesfully completed our task and won an award for "Biggest Real World Impact", for a device that uses sensors to scan and collect pollution in the ocean.
